The `Processing_and_Analysis/Scripts` folder is self explanatory
The `Processing_and_Analysis/Analysis_Data` contain the output tables and plots

///METADATA///
The `Original_Data/Model.csv` contains the mapping of each ModelID from the DepMap 24Q2 dataset to its metadata, of particular interest to us was the specific cell line of each screen in the DepMap

///USAGE///
The `CRISPRGeneDependency.csv` and `CRISPRGeneEffect.csv` from the DepMap 24Q2 dataset were downloaded and imported into R with the `Processing_and_Analysis/Scripts/CRISPR_Dependency.R` script.
The `Original_Data/Model.csv` table was imported into R and modified to generate the output plots.
