///SCRIPTS///
The script `prepare_paired_samples.py` was used to generate the `paired_samples.txt` file for downstream scripts
The script `bsub_hisat2.pl` was used to map reads to hg38 genome, then filter, sort, and index bam files
The script `bsub_featureCounts.pl` was used to extract read counts from each sample
The script `summary_featureCounts.pl` was used to summarize read counts for each sample into a single file to be used in the .Rmd script.

///FOLDERS///
The `alingment` folder contains the statistics for the alignment of each fastq sample to the reference genome, as well as the log files for each performed alignment
The `featureCounts` folder contains read length information, the summarized read counts file resulting from the `summary_featureCounts.pl` script, and the log files for each performed read extraction
The `pipelines` folder contains the scripts that were submitted in the HPC cluster to perform the tasks described in the SCRIPTS section of this guide.
